In this article, we will show you how to use Video Comparer to find and remove duplicate videos on your computer. You will need to download and install the software from its official website[^1^]. You can choose between three versions: Basic, Standard, and Pro. The Basic version is free but has some limitations, such as scanning only 500 files at a time and not showing file names or previews. The Standard version costs $20 and allows scanning up to 10 000 files at a time and showing file names. The Pro version costs $100 and allows scanning unlimited files at a time and showing previews.
 
## Step 1: Launch Video Comparer
 
After installing Video Comparer, launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see the main interface of the software, which consists of four tabs: Scan Folders, Compare Videos, Clean Duplicates, and Settings.
 
## Step 2: Scan Folders
 
In the Scan Folders tab, you can select the folders that contain the videos you want to scan for duplicates. You can add folders by clicking on the Add button or by dragging and dropping them from Windows Explorer. You can also remove folders by clicking on the Remove button or by pressing the Delete key. You can select multiple folders by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking on them.
 
After selecting the folders, you can choose the scan mode from the drop-down menu at the bottom. There are four scan modes available: Quick mode (fast but less accurate), Standard mode (balanced speed and accuracy), Thorough mode (slow but more accurate), and Custom mode (allows you to adjust the scan parameters). The default mode is Standard mode.
 
Once you have selected the scan mode, click on the Start Scan button to begin scanning your folders for video files. The software will display a progress bar and a list of scanned files with their details (name, size, duration, format). You can pause or cancel the scan at any time by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
 
## Step 3: Compare Videos
 
When the scan is completed, click on the Compare Videos tab to see the results of the comparison. The software will group the duplicate videos into clusters and show them as synchronized timeline thumbnails. You can zoom in or out of the thumbnails by using the slider at the bottom. You can also sort the clusters by size or duration by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
 
You can preview any video by double-clicking on its thumbnail or by clicking on the Play button at the top. You can also see more information about any video by right-clicking on its thumbnail or by clicking on the Info button at the top. You can also compare two videos side by side by selecting them and clicking on the Compare button at the top.
 
## Step 4: Clean Duplicates
 
After reviewing the duplicate videos, you can delete them by clicking on the Clean Duplicates tab. The software will show you a list of duplicate clusters with their details (number of files, total size). You can select which clusters you want to delete by checking or unchecking their boxes.
